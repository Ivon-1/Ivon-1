üëã ¬°Hello! I¬¥m [**Ivan Alvarez Garcia**](https://portafolio-tau-five-86.vercel.app/)

I am a web developer with a background in Web Application Development (DAW) and a strong passion for technology and building efficient digital solutions. I specialize in designing and developing intuitive, functional interfaces, always aiming to provide the best user experience.

On the frontend, I have experience with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, React, and SASS, which allows me to create dynamic and visually appealing applications. On the backend, I master PHP, Laravel, MySQL, and PostgreSQL, enabling me to build robust and optimized applications.

I work with Agile and Kanban methodologies, which help me manage projects efficiently and collaborate effectively within a team. I am proactive, organized, and highly adaptable, with a strong ability to learn quickly. I enjoy collaborating with multidisciplinary teams, solving problems, and keeping up with the latest trends in web development.
